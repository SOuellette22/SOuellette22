## About Me

Since I was young, I have always loved solving problems, whether that be solving math problems, figuring out puzzles, or finding creative solutions to everyday challenges. This is why I fell in love with computer science; since there will always be a bug to solve or a client that needs a problem to be solved. Studying here at Merrimack College has helped me realize this passion through all their collaborative project-based courses. Through these projects, my passion for coding has only grown.

## Currently Working On

- Capstone ([Culvert Condition Predictor](https://github.com/SOuellette22/DMS-inc-CSC4910))
  - This project is a three-month collaborative project where my group and I are building a website that will be able to take in certain parameters and give back a rating from 1 to 5 on the condition of the culvert.
  - I am working on the backend of the project using Python to build out the logic of how our AI models will predict the culvert condition based on what information the user enters.

- Networking (Project-Based Courses)
  - This class has 4 projects, each dealing with a different part of the networking fundamentals.
  - We are using Java to build these projects.
